There are several methods to monitor the metrics such as by using (i)Nagios Core, (ii) Zabbix and (iii) custom Python script. One can employee some different technique or tool as per his/her preference
If the metric value is more than defined value, the monitoring system will trig the related trigger, and can send alert message through sms or email and person can also do realtime monitoring via the dashboard of Nagios core or Zabbix or via visualizing the graphs generated by custom Python script

Challenges:
            There are multiple challenges while monitoring, the important could be
            i- Deciding which metrics are important to monitor
            ii- Metrics monitoring tool should not effect the server's performance. When use script method to monitor,history performance value storaging is very time consuming(read and write file)
            iii- Set proper trigger warning value to minimize false alarm
            iv- Most important, monitoring should be done 24/7 and without any unattended session as a small event could also cause a big loss
